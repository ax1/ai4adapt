# Lunar example

Set of tests for using lunar lander as gym (gymnasium) example.

This code allows later to compare with our custom environments, so they behaves as expected in the general gym environments.
This checks also prevents using shiny custom datatypes or non-standard interactions that confuse people importing the custom environment or break general RL algorithms that cannot be applied if conditions are not the same.
