# TODOs
- [ ] Reduce time. Unless a script to have all the actions (so we can test defenses are ok). Then, in caldera operations either execute the script with args 8eg: 1 4 8 execute only those in the script) or execute loop actions with an argument on each execution (to prevent create operations for all the steps and also to handle to reduce the time of each episode for training). NOT POSSIBLE FOR NOW.

- [ ] Model check if we can model.save() and the continue with model.load()+model.train()
